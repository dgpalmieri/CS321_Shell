# goShell (Better name soon)

goShell is, believe it or not, a shell implemented in golang. Currently very under development, this was created as my class project for CS321 Operating Systems.

### Current limitations

* goShell does not support autocompletions
* goShell only supports the following special characters, and only once per command:
    * |  - pipe output to command's input
    * && - execute command one and command two
    * &  - execute command in background
